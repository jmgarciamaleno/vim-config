# Vim-config

My personal vim config and plugins, PHP optimized. Looking for a vim reference? Check my [vim-reference](https://github.com/jmgarciamaleno/vim-reference) project.

I run only one vim instance and work with buffers (opened files). This allows to easily copy/paste content between them, run commands in all of them and keep a controlled set of classes and methods for omni-code completion. NerdTree, MiniBuffExplorer and CtrlP makes really easy to manage buffers.

This is how it looks like. You can see MiniBuffExplorer showing current buffers in the upper line:

## Install

### Automatic

**Requires bash, curl and git**

Script that backups your `~/.vim` folder and your `~/.vimrc` file, git clones my config in `~/vim-config` and creates symlinks to it.

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jmgarciamaleno/vim-config/master/jmgm-vim-install.sh | bash
```

### Manual

1. Backup your current vim files:

    ```bash
    cd ~
    mv .vimrc .vimrc_backup
    mv .vim .vim_backup
    ```

2. Install this project. Replace `<APP_PATH>` with the path you wish:

    ```bash
    cd <APP_PATH>
    git clone https://github.com/jmgarciamaleno/vim-config.git
    ln -s <APP_PATH>/vim-config/vimrc ~/.vimrc
    ln -s <APP_PATH>/vim-config/vim ~/.vim
    ```

## Uninstall

### Automatic

**Requires bash, curl and git**

Script that removes my config and restores your `~/.vim` folder and `~/.vimrc` file previously backed up.

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jmgarciamaleno/vim-config/master/jmgm-vim-uninstall.sh | bash
```

### Manual

1. Uninstall this project. Replace `<APP_PATH>` with the path where you installed this project:

    ```bash
    unlink ~/.vimrc
    unlink ~/.vim
    cd <APP_PATH>
    rm -rf vim-config
    ```

2. If you made a backup of your vim files, recover it:

    ```bash
    cd ~
    mv .vimrc_backup .vimrc
    mv .vim_backup .vim
    ```

## Optional but highly recommended

1. The vim feature *xterm-clipboard* allows to copy/paste content from/to the system clipboard (vim register `+` or `*`).  
   Check `vim --version` to see which features are installed.

   In Ubuntu, the package *vim-gnome* adds the *xterm-clipboard* and other features to vim. To install it:  
   `sudo apt-get install vim-gnome`

2. Install **exuberant-ctags** or **ctags** for better omni-code completion:
   - Debian based systems (Ubuntu): `sudo apt-get install exuberant-ctags`
   - OSX with brew: `brew install ctags`

   Info about how to construct your tags file and use it inside vim below.

3. For PHP: Install the shell tool [php-cs-fixer](http://cs.sensiolabs.org/) to keep PHP coding standards. The [vim-php-cs-fixer](https://github.com/stephpy/vim-php-cs-fixer) plugin allows to make use of it from vim.

## Custom mappings

## Plugins basic commands

### NerdTree

Sidebar file explorer. Press `?` in NerdTree for quick key reference. Basic commands:

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| ctrl-n | Open/close NerdTree |
| o | Open node |
| x | Close parent node |
| s | Open node vertically splitted |

### Ctrl-P

Fuzzy file finder. It works at the path of the buffer from which you open it so I recommend to open NerdTree at your project root and open Ctrl-P from NerdTree.

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| ctrl-p | Open/close Ctrl-P |
| ctrl-d | Change mode between path, files and MRU |
| ctrl-z | Mark multiple files |
| ctrl-o | Open marked files |

### Multiple-cursors

This plugin allows to select the word under the cursor and the next occurrences, to edit them all at the same time.

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| ctrl-k | Switch to select mode and selects word under cursor and next occurrences |
| ctrl-p | (Select mode) Deselect current word |
| ctrl-x | Skip current selected word |

### Exuberant-ctags / Ctags

Not a vim plugin but a shell tool. It constructs a tags file with classes, methods, ... for the given code language and folders.

Run this bash command (replace PHP with your code language) at your project root to construct the tags file with classes and methods only:

```bash
exuberant-ctags --languages=PHP -R --links=no --PHP-kinds=cf <path1_to_your_code> <path2_to_your_code> ...
```
or

```bash
ctags --languages=PHP -R --links=no --PHP-kinds=cf <path1_to_your_code> <path2_to_your_code> ...
```

Run vim at your project root to make use of the created tags file.

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| ctrl-n | (Insert mode) Complete the word being written with the next coincidence |
| ctrl-p | (Insert mode) Complete the word being written with the previous coincidence |
| :tag \<className> | Open the \<className> definition |
| ctrl-] | Open the class/method/variable definition of the word under the cursor |
| ctrl-w + ] | Open the class/method/variable definition of the word under the cursor in a new window |
| ctrl-t | Return to the point where the class/method/variable definition was called |

### Vim-php-cs-fixer

[Php-cs-fixer](http://cs.sensiolabs.org/) is a great shell tool to automatically fix PHP coding standards for the given file, or files under the given folder. This plugin allows to run it from vim.

If you run `\pcf` without arguments, the current buffer is fixed and saved. Reload the buffer with `:e!` to see it updated.

You can set the fixing level that you want to apply in your vim config (my default value is PSR2).

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| \pcf | Fix coding standards of the current buffer |
| \pcf \<file> | Fix coding standards of \<file> |
| \pcd \<folder> | Fix coding standards of files under \<folder> |
